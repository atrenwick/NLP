    "\n",
    "My reccommedation : give each model a 3 digit code number, and put it in a folder with that name. That makes paths a lot simpler, and makes things simpler for you too : model 241 is a lot easier to remember than the specific combination of treebank and BERT-like element, and a whole lot easier if you're going to use multiple models to find which one suits your particular use case\n",
    "\n",
    "HOPS can run as a component in Spacy, as a server, or in the command line. Since the developer already has docs on how to do the first two (https://hopsparser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), we'll look at the last one : running HOPS in your command line, with Python to help out too.\n"
